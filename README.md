# Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student will be placed or not based on academic performance and other factors using Machine Learning.

## Dataset
- File: `placement_dataset.csv`
- Contains academic scores, specialization, work experience, and placement status.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression
- Train-test split used for evaluation
- Performance evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Data Visualization
- Correlation Heatmap to analyze relationships between numerical features

## Model Performance
- Achieved accuracy of around **88%**

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Placement_prediction.ipynb`
3. Run all cells

## Conclusion
The model successfully predicts student placement using academic and test-related features.
